Mental Health in Tech Companies

Analysis of the 2014 OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey

# 📌 Purpose

The dataset used in this project comes from a 2014 survey designed to measure attitudes toward mental health within the tech industry. It includes a wide range of questions from both company and employee perspectives, covering issues such as workplace culture, communication, support mechanisms, and stigma.
This project aims to draw meaningful inferences from the available records and analyze the seriousness and prevalence of mental health challenges in tech firms in 2014. Through data analysis and modeling, we explore how employees perceive mental health, how companies respond, and what factors may influence mental well-being in tech workplaces.

# 💡 Inspiration

The tech industry’s rapid growth has made it a highly desirable field. However, its demanding, fast-paced, and high-pressure environments can contribute significantly to mental health challenges.
This project examines how organizational culture, workplace norms, and support systems influence employee mental health in tech companies.

📊 Dataset

Source: 2014 OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey
File: Tech.csv

Each row represents a tech employee and contains demographic information, workplace characteristics, mental-health-related responses, and attitudes toward seeking help.

# 🔧 Methodology

The analysis consists of four major steps:

1. Data Cleaning

Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalizing fields, and preparing the dataset for analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing distributions, identifying trends, examining demographic imbalances, and uncovering patterns related to mental health openness and support.

3. Machine Learning – Random Forest Classification

Building a classification model to study which features predict mental health outcomes.

4. Statistical Inference

Performing hypothesis testing to evaluate associations between workplace factors and mental health indicators.
